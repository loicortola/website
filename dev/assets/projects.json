Simply reinvent the way people learn computer-science, and the way we get our new recruits.  \r\nThe project is a year-long project and should be OpenSourced before the end of year 2018.  \r\n\r\n![Deadlock player dashboard](images/deadlock-1.jpg)![Deadlock story hall](images/deadlock-2.jpg)  \r\n\r\nWant to take part in the project? **Message me**!",

Therefore, I started doing a few libs and other stuff to help during personal projects.  \r\n #### **SSDP** Java Client:  \r\nIt was hard to find a good implementation for SSDP on the web, so I made my own. Asynchronous, lightweight, and bullet-proof. [See it here](https://github.com/resourcepool/ssdp-client).  \r\n #### **JSON-RPC 2.0** Java client:  \r\nA lightweight full implementation of JSON-RPC 2.0 in Java. Compatible with Java 6 and above. Available on central. [Let's see it](https://github.com/resourcepool/jarpic-client)  \r\n #### LUA Http-server for **NodeMCU** & **ESP-8266** microcontrollers:  \r\nLow-level, memory-efficient, node-like API & middleware compatible. [Let's see it](https://github.com/loicortola/nodemcu-espress)  \r\n #### End-to-end **5050 Led Controller**:  \r\nPCB Board + Hardware list + Firmware + Android app.  \r\nGreat to learn how to make IoT objects and get some awesome sample code running. Now currently working on bigger API refactorings to be compatible with Xiaomi devices and on a Zigbee Light Link implementation with NXP microcontrollers.
