 ### Why do you wake up in the morning?
 ### What gives you energy in your everyday life?

My name is **Loïc**.
I am a reader, a music junkie, a travel addict, and a fulltime geek.


I love Java, Reactive programming, Maps, and DevOps.  
I enjoy contributing on OpenSource projects, hacking IoT devices, and sharing my passion anywhere I can.

I spend my energy and time in different ways:  
 * As the Advocate of Takima, spreading the word about latest tech trends in Meetups, Conferences and so on
 * As the CTO of Jawg Maps, the new disruptive mapping platform in Europe
 * In tech-related non-profits such as HAND, Resourcepool, or Hermitage.

## Hackers Against Natural Disasters

On the side, I am a board member of **H.A.N.D.** (**H**ackers **A**gainst **N**atural **D**isasters), a non-profit organization involving hackers to fight natural disasters with technology, save lives and raise awareness. 
The latest operation (codename Caribe Wave 2018) was about creating POC hacks, tools and devices in response to the **UNESCO Earthquake & Tsunami** scenario played in the Caribbeans. It took place in Guadeloupe and was covered by many local medias and French newspapers. See the retrospective [here (french)](http://hand.team/#hand).

## Spare geeky-time

I spend (waaaaayyy) too much time in my local Fablab, love making my own drones and use **3D printers**, **CNCs** and **laser-cut** devices for fun or sometimes real stuff ^^. 
Last but not least, I enjoy contributing on **Java** / **IoT** / **training** OpenSource projects and hacking IoT devices. In 2014, we launched a small organization called Resourcepool (https://resourcepool.io) to help create Training content for universities, students, and entry-level devs.

Most of my current OpenSource contributions are detailed in the Projects page.

Interested in what we do? Shoot me an email and let's discuss it.

Some time ago, I realized I **loved** inspiring others by sharing my passion and respect for our job. 
I feel grateful for sharing thoughts all around Europe about things I care about:  
Happiness at Work, and Technology: Java, Android, DevOps, Performance Tuning, the history & future of the web, etc…

So far, I was involved with Epitech, INSA Lyon, École 42 (Xavier Niel), CPE Lyon, INSA Rouen, Mines de Nantes, Mines de Douai, Université Paris 7, ECE Paris, ISART Paris, EPF Sceaux, Université de Technologie de Troyes, Université de Rouen, CESI Nancy, ENSI Caen, ESAIP Angers, Faculté d'Orsay, ENSTA ParisTech, Université de Technologie de Compiègne.

I wish you an amazing day.
