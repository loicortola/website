[Kahoot](https://www.kahoot.com) is a great Quizz platform mostly used for educational purposes!\r\n\r\nFor Takima, we wanted to have a **better** and **cooler** controller than just a normal phone... So we made [TaKahoot](https://github.com/resourcepool/takahoot).\r\n\r\nTakahoot is a physical target for Kahoot that behaves as a normal player and allows to be trigged by a nice shot from your favorite Nerf gun.\r\n\r\n![Takahoot Box](images/takahoot-box.jpg)![Takahoot Triggers before mount](images/takahoot-triggers.jpg)\r\n\r\nWe made everything from scratch, from the **3D STL models**, printed some parts with a 3D Printer, cut some others with a laser-cutting device, implemented the controller with a simple Serial protocol with Arduino and of course a great user-friendly client in Electron & Angular.",

Together with some friends, we came up with a cool concept: **Live Blindtests**!\r\n\r\nIt was easy and fun to guess when you had 20 people playing... Not the same with 500.\r\n\r\nSo we built an app to answer live, play jokers and provide people with an incredible gameplay while they will also cry out loud their favorite songs!\r\n\r\n![Blind Test Live helper app](images/blindtest-live-1.jpg)![Blind Test Live leaderboard](images/blindtest-live-2.jpg)\r\n\r\nWanna get crazy?

Therefore, I started doing a few libs and other stuff to help during personal projects.  \r\n #### **SSDP** Java Client:  \r\nIt was hard to find a good implementation for SSDP on the web, so I made my own. Asynchronous, lightweight, and bullet-proof. [See it here](https://github.com/resourcepool/ssdp-client).  \r\n #### **JSON-RPC 2.0** Java client:  \r\nA lightweight full implementation of JSON-RPC 2.0 in Java. Compatible with Java 6 and above. Available on central. [Let's see it](https://github.com/resourcepool/jarpic-client)  \r\n #### LUA Http-server for **NodeMCU** & **ESP-8266** microcontrollers:  \r\nLow-level, memory-efficient, node-like API & middleware compatible. [Let's see it](https://github.com/loicortola/nodemcu-espress)  \r\n #### End-to-end **5050 Led Controller**:  \r\nPCB Board + Hardware list + Firmware + Android app.  \r\nGreat to learn how to make IoT objects and get some awesome sample code running. Now currently working on bigger API refactorings to be compatible with Xiaomi devices and on a Zigbee Light Link implementation with NXP microcontrollers.
